This plugin highlights the optimal characters to target for the f, F, t and T motions for easier and faster left-right movement in Vim.

If you don't routinely use these keys you should! See ':help f' and ':help ;' to get started and https://github.com/unblevable/quick-scope#moving-across-a-line for a detailed look at why these keys
are so useful.

In practice, this plugin should help you get to any word on a line in two or three keystrokes with built-in Vim commands.
